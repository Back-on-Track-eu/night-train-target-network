  ├── (auto_stop_addition NOT re-run — known_auto_added_stop_ids from outbound

  ├── ...same remaining steps as outbound...
  ├── Trip._create(...)                                            → Trip (return)
  │
  └── Route._create(schedule, trip_pairs, parkings, shuntings)  → Route

distribute_demand(route, utilization_per, fare_per_km_by_class)  → Route (with od_pairs)

evaluate_route(route, tracks, stop_infra)  → EvaluationResult   [calc.py]

build_breakdown*(route, result)            → Breakdown matrices  [views.py]
```

`timetable_mode`, `schedule_mode`, and `auto_stop_addition` each have their
switch (which named behaviour runs) in `route_factory.py`, at whichever
level owns the relevant context — `schedule_mode` in `plan_route()` (route-
level, shared across every `TripPair`), `timetable_mode` in `_build_trip()`
(per-trip, since departure time is direction-specific). `auto_stop_addition`
is per-`TripPair`, not per-trip: `_build_trip_pair()` runs it once from
outbound and reuses the result (reversed) for return, rather than
re-running the whole candidate-search-and-cost pass for what is physically
the same corridor reversed — that pass, not routing itself, is the
dominant cost of planning a route through a dense stop catalog. Return
still gets its own real routing call for its own (possibly asymmetric)
physical path; only the decision of *which stops to add* is shared, not
the routing. Accepted trade-off: return no longer gets an independent
detour-budget check against its own baseline trip time. `timetable.py` holds
one function per named behaviour and never branches on the mode/flag
itself — see that module's docstring. `VALID_TIMETABLE_MODES` /
`VALID_SCHEDULE_MODES` in `timetable.py` are the single source of truth
both `api/route.py`'s request validation and `route_factory.py`'s
switches read from. For schedule-only changes on an already-built Route
(departure time, stop types), `adjust_route()` still exists but isn't
currently reachable from the API — see `api/README.md`.

## Separation of concerns

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `route_factory.py` | Sole constructor for `Trip`, `TripPair`, `Route` — orchestrates the full plan/adjust pipeline |
| `rail_router.py` | HTTP calls to routing engine, country attribution, buffer computation → `RoutedLeg` |
| `calc_energy_consumption.py` | Energy model — enriches `RoutedLeg.energy_kwh` |
| `calc.py` | All monetary values — produces flat `EvaluationResult` with one cost object per event |
| `views.py` | Aggregation, allocation, and normalisation — produces `Breakdown` matrices |
| `trip.py` | Physics domain objects: `Stop`, `Segment`, `Trip`. No monetary values |
| `route.py` | Route container: `Route`, `TripPair`, `Parking`, `Shunting`, `ODPair`, `Schedule` |
| `params.py` | Immutable parameter dataclasses loaded from DB |

**Strict boundary:** `Trip` and `Route` carry physics only. All EUR values live
exclusively in `calc.py`. All serialization lives in `api/helpers/` — split by
domain into `route_serialize.py`, `evaluation_serialize.py`, `params_serialize.py`,
`proposal_serialize.py`, `feedback_serialize.py`, and `scenario_serialize.py`.

## Key domain objects

### Trip and Route

`Stop` — one stop call on a trip. `country_code` from `StopInfrastructure`.
`stop_type` is `BOARDING`, `ALIGHTING`, or `BOTH` — controls which OD pairs
are valid and whether station charges apply. `auto_added` is `True` for a
stop inserted by `auto_stop_addition` rather than supplied by the caller.

`Segment` — one leg between two consecutive stops. Carries physics:
`distance_m`, `driving_time_min`, `buffer_time_min`, `energy_kwh`,
`country_distance_shares`, `country_time_shares`.

`TripPair` — outbound + return trip sharing one `Composition`. Carries `od_pairs`
(demand for this pair) and `composition` (cost parameters).

`Route` — container for trip pairs, schedule, parkings, and shuntings.
`Route.countries` derives all countries from segment shares and stop locations.
`Route.shuntings` lists one `Shunting` per trip terminal (no deduplication).
`Route.parkings` lists one `Parking` per unique terminal stop (deduplicated).

### Parking and Shunting

`Parking` — overnight stabling. One per unique terminal stop across all trips.
Has `trip_ids` listing which trips park there. Cost rate from `TrackInfrastructure.parking_eur_day`.

`Shunting` — coupling/uncoupling movement. One per trip terminal, not deduplicated.
Has `trip_id`. Cost rate from `TrackInfrastructure.shunting_eur_event`.

### ODPair

`ODPair` — annual demand for one origin→destination×class combination on one trip.
Lives on `TripPair.od_pairs`. `places_sold` is annual (per-trip demand = `places_sold / operating_days`).
Valid OD pairs have a `BOARDING`/`BOTH` origin and `ALIGHTING`/`BOTH` destination.

## ID convention

GTFS-compatible string IDs:

```
route_id : P{proposal_id}_V{proposal_version}_R1
trip_id  : P{proposal_id}_V{proposal_version}_R1_D{direction}_T{index}

e.g. P1_V1_R1       — route for proposal 1, version 1
     P1_V1_R1_D0_T1 — outbound trip
     P1_V1_R1_D1_T1 — return trip
```

`proposal_id` is stable across versions. `proposal_version` increments on every change.

`route_factory.py` itself only ever sees concrete ints for both — a brand new
proposal (not yet saved, no real DB id) is resolved at the API boundary
(`api/route.py`) before `plan_route()` is called: a random placeholder
`proposal_id` above one billion is assigned and `proposal_version` is forced
to `1`. This is a stand-in for a future scenarios/proposals module that will
properly own draft-vs-saved handling; `route_factory.py` doesn't need to know
"not saved yet" is even a possible state.

## Unit conventions

| Quantity | Unit | Suffix |
|---|---|---|
| Distance | metres | `_m` |
| Duration | minutes | `_min` |
| Clock time | minutes from midnight day 1 | `_min` |
| Energy | kWh | `_kwh` |
| Cost | EUR | `_eur` |
| Share / rate | dimensionless | `_per` |

---

## Energy model

Energy consumption is estimated per segment using a regression model:

```
energy_kwh = total_weight_t × distance_km × (
    factor_weight
    + factor_speed   × avg_speed_kmh²
    + factor_terrain × terrain_score
)
```

Coefficients are stored on `CompositionType`. Terrain score comes from
`TrackInfrastructure` per country. **Currently using a flat 28.0 kWh/km
dummy factor** — calibration against Deutsche Bahn Trassenfinder data is pending.
See `models/energy/README.md` for calibration guidance.
